<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Anannya — an aspiring engineer with a passion for technology, creativity, and problem-solving. I enjoy building solutions that make a real-world impact, whether it's through coding, UI/UX design, or collaborative innovation.

Currently pursuing my engineering degree, I've explored various fields including web development, C programming, Linux, and data structures. I’ve also gained hands-on experience with tools like Figma and Webflow, and participated in events like Ideathons that sharpen both my technical and teamwork skills.

I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and growing — always looking for opportunities to create, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful projects.
